Tic Tac Toe game using the Minimax Algorithm and the concepts of AI.
It is also multiplayer, has difficulty levels and gives suggestions too for playing the best move.
Our AI agent is an Utility-Based Agent.
Utility Based Agents are goal-oriented agent but provide an extra component of utility measurement which makes them different by providing a measure of success at a given state.
Utility-based agent act based not only goals but also the best way to achieve the goal.
The Utility-based agent is useful when there are multiple possible alternatives, and an agent has to choose in order to perform the best action.
The minimax function maps each terminal state to a real number to check how efficiently each action achieves the goals.
